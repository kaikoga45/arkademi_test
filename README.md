# Arkademi Test

The Arkademi Test project is a crucial assignment offered by Arkademi to aspiring Mobile Flutter Engineers. The primary objective of this app is to meticulously replicate the exact UI/UX design and features provided in the prototype while interfacing with an API. However, due to the unavailability of access to the original online and offline video links, a custom API has been created to mimic the functionalities provided by the original API. The key difference lies in the custom API, which now integrates new video links.

## Features to be Implemented:
1. Streaming Online Video Playback: Facilitate the seamless streaming of online videos, not downloaded content.
2. Video Download Feature: Enable users to download videos for offline viewing.
3. Offline Video Playback: Allow the playback of downloaded videos while offline.
4. Deletion of Downloaded Videos: Implement functionality to remove previously downloaded videos.
5. Restricted Access to Downloaded Video Storage: Ensure that the stored downloaded videos are inaccessible to users.
6. State Management Utilization (BLoC): Utilize state management effectively, serving as a valuable additional asset to the project.
7. Implementation of Unit and Widget Testing: Incorporate mandatory unit and widget testing for comprehensive app reliability and functionality assessment.

This Arkademi app project requires a focused approach to replicating the provided UI/UX and API functionalities while addressing the challenges posed by unavailable original links. Successful completion of this project will showcase adeptness in implementing video streaming, download management, offline playback, data security, state management, and comprehensive testing protocols within a Flutter environment.
